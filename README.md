This Repsitory is contain all my Work and Projects of artificial Intelligence and machine Learning with python Internship with Training at Falcon's Beyondtheimagination company. This is 45 days Internship with Training.
In This Internship
Phase 1. Python Programming: Get comfortable with Python syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries), control flow (if/else, loops), functions, and basic libraries like NumPy and Pandas.



Python Operators: Arithmetic operators Assignment operators Comparison operators Logical operators Identity operators Membership operators Bitwise operators

Python's basic data types : Numeric Sequence Type Boolean Set Dictionary Binary Types( memoryview, bytearray, bytes)

Control statements in Python: Python uses "If", "Elif", "Else" statements, loops like "For" and "While", and control statements like "Break", "Continue", and "Pass".

Phase 2. Data Analysis :

Python Libraries for AI & ML: SciPy(scientific computations) NumPy (numerical computing) Pandas (data manipulation and analysis) Matplotlib/Seaborn (data visualization) Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for creating statistical graphics with a focus on clarity and aesthetics. Scikit-learn: A comprehensive library for machine learning tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and model selection.


Phase 3. machine learning
